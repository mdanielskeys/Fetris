# Fetris
A Tetris clone to learn old DOS programming.

# Building
This up to be build with Wacom compiler with DOS4GW on DOSBox. There were many hours spent getting that setup, and there is probably no reason that it needed to be DOS4GW.

# TODO
Still need to add PC sound. There are some beginnings of doing that, but I never managed to complete it.

Need to add levels after number of rows complete, and need to speed up the game as the player progresses.

Make it so I can build with a modern compiler back down to DOSBox rather than setting up Wacom
